  # Introduction to Ansible automation controller

  Welcome to our interactive workshop on Red Hat Single Sign-On with Ansible for Middleware; during the workshop, we will be using Ansible automation controller,
  the web-based UI interface for Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform.

  In this lab, we will find a web application deployed on JBoss EAP and served via JBoss Core Services: after learning how Ansible and the Middleware Automation collections
  can help to setup such an environment, we will install and deploy an additional highly available authentication service, Red Hat Single Sign-On, using an additional certified
  collection, and we will update the deployment of the web application with a new version requiring an external authentication mechanism.

  This workshop is useful for both experienced Ansible users and beginners. No prior experience is required, although understanding playbook development concepts will help.

  We will create an inventory to manage our servers, import our playbooks through the Projects, create Job Templates to run the playbooks and finally, update the web application.

  This workshop covers the following topics for automation controller and middleware automation collections:

  * Exploring the dashboard and web-UI interface
  * Exploring how to make use of collections for automating complex tasks
  * Deploying a stack of services to target instances using job templates
    * Red Hat JBoss Core Services
    * Red Hat Enterprise Application Platform
  * Making changes to collection configuration to reiterate deployments
    * Red Hat Single Sign-On
    * Red Hat Enterprise Application Platform
