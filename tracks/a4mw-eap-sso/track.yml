  # Introduction to Ansible automation controller

  Welcome to our interactive lab on Ansible automation controller, the web-based UI interface for Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform.

  In this lab, ...

  This intro laboratory is useful for both, experienced Ansible users and beginners. No prior experience is required, although understanding playbook development concepts will help.

  We will create an inventory to manage our servers, import our playbooks through the Projects, create Job Templates to run the playbooks and finally, create a Workflow linking a few of those playbooks through success or failure conditions.

  This lab covers the following topics for automation controller:

  * Exploring the dashboard and web-UI interface
  * Creating and managing our `Inventory`
  * How to import playbooks through `Projects`
  * How to create `Job Templates` to run our playbooks
  * Understanding the `Credentials` feature to configure authentication
  * How to create  `Workflow Templates` linking different playbooks through conditions

  We will also explore a few of the additional features in the automation controller that can help with your enterprise automation needs, and we will dive deeper into them in a future laboratory.
