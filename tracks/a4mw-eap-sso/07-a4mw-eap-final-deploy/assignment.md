 üí° Final Deployment
===
#### Estimated time to complete: *10 minutes*<p>

It's time to wrap up everything we did.

We examined Ansible playbooks and deployed middleware services and web application on a multi-host environment. Then we updated the revision control system with a new version of the web application, we added playbooks to deploy a new service and configure it so that such web application could leverage additional middleware services. Lets execute the final result of our work, and get the complete system up and running.


‚òëÔ∏è Task 1 - Locate and run the deploy Template
===

1. Switch to the **Automation controller** tab
2. On the side navigation bar, under the **Resources** section, click on **Templates**
3. Click on the **sso-eap-deploy** template
4. On the page that opens, click the **Launch** button
5. The launch dialog opens the **Survey**, asking for credentials (defaults are already set), click **Next**
6. Click **Launch**; you will be redirected the executing job output page.


‚òëÔ∏è Task 2 - Validate deployment
===

1. Follow the job execution output up to the end
2. Note that all tasks should be ok (green) or skip (cyan), except the new **sso_realm** playbook will be executed, and in the **eap** playbook, the updated yml configuration file will be installed, and the eap service restarted to load it.
3. When the execution ends successfully, click on the **addressbook** tab: it will open a new browser window
4. You should be redirected by the application to a login form, which is provided by Single Sign-On
5. Login with `user` and the password you selected in the previous challenge
6. The successful login in SSO loads in the session the user details, then SSO redirects back to the JBoss EAP web application
7. Welcome to the updated web application using the external authentication mechanism. EAP loaded the user attributes from the session, allowed to access the webapplication because the `user` account was found in the `user_role` role. Finally, if you check the top right corner, the addressbook web application also loaded the user details in the session to show your name. When you are done, close the browser window and come back here, for some final reasonings.


‚òëÔ∏è Task 3 - Final thoughts
===

So, this chapter was titled 'Final Deployment'; but would it be so?

We have seen that playbook executions can report their final outcome, for each task that has been evaluated or run by Ansible, and as an aggregation of **_changes made_/_no change needed_** actions.
We have also noticed that the time of execution changes remarkably when executions run on already deployed systems, and no changes where made to the revision control system.

Wouldn't it be wiser to setup an automation that continuously, repeatedly runs our playbooks against our live envirnment, confirming the configuration is what it is expected to be, and/or pro-actively amend any drift from what it was supposed to be? maybe every few minutes?

We think it is. And with the birth of Event-Driven Ansible, this can and will reach even higher levels of control, adding reactive behaviours to pro-active ones.

Farewell, and thanks for your participation in this workshop!
