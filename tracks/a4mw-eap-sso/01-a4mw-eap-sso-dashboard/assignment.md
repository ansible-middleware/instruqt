    # Welcome to Ansible automation controller

    Welcome to our interactive lab: this first part will be on Ansible automation controller, the web-based UI interface for **Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform**.

    In this lab, we will demonstrate how easy it is to use automation controller and the Middleware Automation collections to setup complex environments.

    Let's explore the web-UI interface, in order to get comfortable with what is already configured in.

    The Dashboard view begins with a summary of your hosts, inventories, and projects. Each of these is linked to the corresponding objects for easy access.

    Access the Jobs view by clicking Jobs from the left navigation bar. This view shows all the jobs that have ran, including projects, templates, management jobs, SCM updates, playbook runs, etc.

    Access the Inventories view by clicking Inventories from the left navigation bar. This view shows all the inventories that are configured.

    An Inventory is a collection of hosts and groups against which jobs may be launched, the same as an Ansible inventory file.

üëã Introduction to automation controller
===
#### Estimated time to complete: *5 minutes*<p>

Automation controller, formerly known as Ansible Tower, allows users of Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform to define, operate, scale, and delegate automation across their enterprise through a web-based UI or API.

The screen on the left shows the login screen. You can log in with the following credentials and then continue on to the tasks:

* Username: `admin`
* Password: `ansible123!`

‚òëÔ∏è Task 1 - Explore the Dashboard
===

Explore the Dashboard view.  Currently the Dashboard wont show much information since it has just been deployed, but you will be able to visit again once you finished the lab and notice the difference.

You will find the following buttons:

* Hosts
* Failed hosts
* Inventories
* Inventory sync fail
* Projects
* Projects sync fail.


‚òëÔ∏è Task 2 - Explore the inventories section
===

An **Inventory** is a collection of hosts against which playbooks may be launched, the same as an Ansible inventory file you might know from working with Ansible on the command line.

Click on the **Inventories** button in the Dashboard or the link in the sidebar menu and explore the **eap-sso** inventory that comes pre-loaded. Don't forget to look at the tabs!

In particular, the **Sources** tab page will list the inventories that are dinamically loaded from the project files. Open the **eap-sso-source** item and verify that its *Inventory file* option
points to the `inventory/inventory` file inside the **eap-sso** project.

Now click the **Sync** button: this will start the syncing between the hosts available to Ansible controller and those defined in the project git repository inventory. You will notice the field *Last Job Status* now reports **Pending** status, and after a few seconds **Running**; and eventually it will report **Successful** after the execution terminates.

When the syncing is completed, on the tab bar, now click on **Back to Sources**, then the **Hosts** tab, and examine the hosts configured in the inventory:
  * `jbcs-eap` will execute Jboss Core Services and Jboss Enterprise Application platform, and belongs to the `db`, `jbcs`, and `eap` groups
  * `sso1` and `sso2` will provide the Single Sign-On authentication service, and belong to the `sso` group


‚òëÔ∏è Task 3 - Explore the projects section
===

**Projects** are logical groups of Ansible playbooks in automation controller. These playbooks usually reside in a source code version control system like Git (and platforms as Github or Gitlab). With **Projects** we can reference a repository or directory with one or several playbooks, that we will later use.

Click on the **Projects** button in the Dashboard or the link in the sidebar menu and explore the **eap-sso** project. The important settings in this configuration page, are the:

* *Source Control URL*: the project is bound to a git repository called **eap-sso** located in the home directory for the _rhel_ user of the _control_ host.
* *Update revision on launch*: setting this instructs the Ansible controller to verify if new commits are available in the git repository every time the template associated with project is executed.


‚òëÔ∏è Task 4 - Explore the templates section
===

**Templates** are execution configurations, same concept as Ansible playbook. 

Click on the Templates link in the sidebar menu and explore the **eap-sso-deploy** template that comes pre-loaded. You will notice that it points to `deploy.yml` playbook inside the git repository
provided by the **eap-sso** project we have inspected in _Task 3_; in the next track sections we will use a code editor to open that git repository, make changes, and run new deployments using this job template. 

If you click on the **Survey** tab, you'll find a pair of credentials which are configured to be set at every execution (do not mind the values, they have been set and encrypted by default): those enable the Ansible Middleware collection to perform downloads from the Red Hat Customer Portal automatically via a feature called **Jboss Network Download API**. Surveys are an important feature
of Ansible controller because they allow to manage variables, possibly secrets, which are not good enough candidates for ansible vault files, or external secret management services which
do not depend on the user that executes the deployment.
