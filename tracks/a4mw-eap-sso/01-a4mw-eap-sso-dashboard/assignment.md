    # Welcome to Ansible automation controller

    Welcome to our interactive lab: this first part will be on Ansible automation controller, the web-based UI interface for **Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform**.

    In this lab, we will demonstrate how easy it is to use automation controller and the Middleware Automation collections to setup complex environments.

    Let's explore the web-UI interface, in order to get comfortable with what is already configured in.

üëã Introduction to automation controller
===
#### Estimated time to complete: *3 minutes*<p>

Automation controller, formerly known as Ansible Tower, allows users of Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform to define, operate, scale, and delegate automation across their enterprise through a web-based UI or API.

The screen on the left shows the login screen. You can log in with the following credentials and then continue on to the tasks:

* Username: `admin`
* Password: `ansible123!`

‚òëÔ∏è Task 1 - Explore the Dashboard
===

Explore the Dashboard view.  Currently the Dashboard wont show much information since it has just been deployed, but you will be able to visit again once you finished the lab and notice the difference.

You will find the following buttons:

* Hosts
* Failed hosts
* Inventories
* Inventory sync fail
* Projects
* Projects sync fail.


‚òëÔ∏è Task 2 - Explore the inventories section
===

An **Inventory** is a collection of hosts against which playbooks may be launched, the same as an Ansible inventory file you might know from working with Ansible on the command line.

Click on the **Inventories** button in the Dashboard or the link in the sidebar menu and explore the **eap-sso** inventory that comes pre-loaded. Don't forget to look at the tabs!


‚òëÔ∏è Task 3 - Explore the projects section
===

**Projects** are logical groups of Ansible playbooks in automation controller. These playbooks usually reside in a source code version control system like Git (and platforms as Github or Gitlab). With **Projects** we can reference a repository or directory with one or several playbooks, that we will later use.

Click on the **Projects** button in the Dashboard or the link in the sidebar menu and explore the **eap-sso-deploy** project that comes pre-loaded. Don't forget to look at the tabs!


‚úÖ Next Challenge
===
Press the `Next` button below to go to the next challenge once you‚Äôve completed the tasks.
