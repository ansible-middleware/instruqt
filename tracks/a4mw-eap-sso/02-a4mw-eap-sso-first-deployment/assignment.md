    # Our first deployments

    In this challenge, now that our project setup is finalized, we will start our first deployment.

    At the end of deployment, two services will be up and running on the `jbcs-eap` node:
    * JBCS is a web server and reverse proxy, accepting https requests and proxying down to EAP
    * EAP is an application container, running a custom java web application called *addressbook*

üóÉÔ∏è First deployment
===
#### Estimated time to complete: *15 minutes*<p>

Now that we are comfortable with the Ansible controller configuration, we can actually execute the very first playbook, which:

* Installs pre-requisite packages and resources on all hosts
* Installs JBoss Core Services on the **jbcs-eap** host
* Installs JBoss Enterprise Application Platform on the **jbcs-eap** host
* Deploys the **addressbook** web application on the JBoess EAP service


‚òëÔ∏è Task 1 - Locate and run the deploy Template
===

1. On the side navigation bar, under the **Resources** section, click on **Templates**
2. Click on the **sso-eap-deploy** template
3. On the page that opens, click the **Launch** button
4. The launch dialog open, asking for credentials (defaults are already set), click **Next**
5. Click **Launch**; you will be redirected the executing job output page.
6. Wait for the job to finish; you can scroll the output to have glimpse of what is being executed.
7. Notice how each task output is colored differently; colors correspond to outcome status, which is very important in ansible:
 * **OK (green)** indicates that no change was applied by tasks because the configuration was already found as expected.
 * **CHANGED (yellow)** indicates that the wanted configuration has been applied, thus generating a change.
 * **FATAL (red)** indicates that the tasks failed for some reason; sometimes the failure is fatal, other times you will see the playbook recovers the situation, showing **FAILED - TRYING (black)**.
 * **SKIPPED (cyan)** indicates a tasks that was not executed, either because the playbook decided so, or because of some condition not allowing it run.



‚òëÔ∏è Task 2 - Verify the services are deployed
===

1. On the window top bar, locate and click the "JBCS-mcm" tab
2. The page should show **mod_cluster/1.3.16.Final-10** in the heading. This means JBCS is operational; if it does not, try to click the ‚Üª 'refresh' button on the right side of the top bar
3. In page content, you should see "jbcs-eap/ajp". This means EAP is operational, and attached to JBCS modcluster (reverse proxy) facility.
4. Now on the top bar, locate and click the "addressbook" tab
5. Our sample web application should open; if it does not, try to click the ‚Üª 'refresh' button on the right side of the top bar
