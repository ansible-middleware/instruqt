Getting up to speed with Ansible Middleware is easy and only requires a few steps. This tutorial demonstrates and guides you through the process of preparing a local machine with the necessary tooling and then deploying an instance of Wildfly using the Wildfly collection provided by Ansible Middleware.

For this tutorial, we are using an Execution Environment and the ansible-navigator utility to perform the automation and provisioning of the Wildfly instance. Install and configure ansible-navigator based on the documentation for your target operating system. To perform the execution of the automation, the ansible-middleware-ee Execution Environment provided by the Ansible Middleware team includes all of the Ansible Middleware collections and their dependencies, so there is no need to install any additional components on the control node. We would be using our execution environment as it already includes all of our latest collections so we donâ€™t have to set it up again.


Once the virtual machine is up and running, Let's now check the version of RHEL its on using the following command:

```
cat /etc/redhat-release
```

Install ansible-navigator:

```
python3 -m pip install --user ansible
```


Install ansible-navigator:

```
python3 -m pip install ansible-navigator --user
```

Once ansible-navigator has been installed, execute the following command to browse all of the collections that are included within the Execution Environment Image:

```
ansible-navigator --eei quay.io/ansible-middleware/ansible-middleware-ee:latest collections
```
